DOSBox 0.63 CVS (15.02.2006) PocketPC Port.

Some tips:
1. Do not try to run "modern" ;) games. Games released before 1993 should run OK. 
2. Use core=verysimple setting where possible.
3. Don't set cycles larger then 1000-2000.
4. Play with frameskip - 3-5 is OK for almost every game.
5. Overclock your processor (use XCPUScalar or similar). But use with care
6. If there's any GAPI "tweakers" for your PDA - use them.
