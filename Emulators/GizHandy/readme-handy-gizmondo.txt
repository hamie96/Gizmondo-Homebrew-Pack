-GizHandy - Handy port v0.01g - 2006 by Per Sterner/TuskenRaider

v0.1g
This is my first version or the gizmondo.
It took a while to get it working, but it's very slow compared to the gp2x version.. although using frameskip with 8, the speed is slower then the gp2x version at 200mhz.

Not working yet:
- No Sound
- directory selection
- keyconfig
- cpuspeed selection
- ...

The roms must be in the directory where the executable is.
