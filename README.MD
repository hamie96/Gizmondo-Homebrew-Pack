# Gizmondo Homebrew Pack

Thanks to Critical Hippo, Reesy, sweetlilmre, and Notaz for their support and help in gathering Gizmondo binaries.
Special thanks goes to sweetlilmre who helped me fix issues with running Grodo on my Gizmondo.

Please use Firefly's Launcher. Firefly's Launcher allows you to play all the emulators without having to run WindowsCE mode.
Simply place the autorun from the Firefly folder onto the root of your SD card.
A few emulators such as SquidgEngine will not work with Firefly's launcher. A way around this is to rename them to
SquidgEngine.exe and place them on the root of the SD card alongside a generic autorun file. In this case, make sure to rename
Firefly's Launcher to something other than autorun.

## Updating Your Gizmondo to Service Pack B:
1. Place autorun.exe and install.bin onto the root
of your SD card
2. Run autorun.exe from the Games Directory

## Using LockNLoad with FireFly's Launcher
(LockNLoad is an application that allows you to boot the Gizmondo into WindowsCE)
1. Copy the wince folder to the root of the SD card
2. Copy LocknLoad.exe and LocknLoad.ini to the wince folder
3. Rename LocknLoad.exe to wince.exe
3. Place the gizmoboot.cfg and AUTORUN.EXE on the root of the SD card
4. Launch FireFly Launcher and then scroll down to wince

(Note: psx4giz does not currently work right now. I am unsure if there are files missing or if the emulator is compiled for a different system. Please contact me if you have a working version of the psx4giz file.)
