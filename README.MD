# Gizmondo Homebrew Pack

Thanks to Critical Hippo, Reesy, sweetlilmre, and Notaz for their support and help in gathering Gizmondo binaries.
Special thanks goes to sweetlilmre who helped me fix issues with running Grodo on my Gizmondo.

## ***Getting Started with FireFly's Launcher***
Firefly's Launcher is a custom Gizmondo launcher that allows you to easily launch homebrew emulators and programs without having to use the WindowsCE mode. Most emulators in this pack will work with Firefly's Launcher, however some (like SquidgEngine.exe) are designed to only work with WindowsCE mode.

## Using LockNLoad with FireFly's Launcher

2. Copy LocknLoad.exe and LocknLoad.ini to the wince folder
3. Rename LocknLoad.exe to wince.exe

(Note: psx4giz does not currently work right now. I am unsure if there are files missing or if the emulator is compiled for a different system. Please contact me if you have a working version of the psx4giz file.)
